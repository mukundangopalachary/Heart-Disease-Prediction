# HEART DISEASE PREDICTION

## LOGISTIC REGRESSION

Logistic regression is defined as a supervised machine learning algorithm that accomplishes binary classification tasks by predicting the probability of an outcome, event, or observation. This article explains the fundamentals of logistic regression, its mathematical equation and assumptions, types, and best practices for 2022.


Logical regression analyzes the relationship between one or more independent variables and classifies data into discrete classes. It is extensively used in predictive modeling, where the model estimates the mathematical probability of whether an instance belongs to a specific category or not.

### Introduction

A heart attack (Cardiovascular diseases) occurs when the flow of blood to the heart muscle suddenly becomes blocked. From WHO statistics every year 17.9 million dying from heart attack. The medical study says that human life style is the main reason behind this heart problem. Apart from this there are many key factors which warns that the person may/maynot getting chance of heart attack.

### Dataset

This dataset contain some medical information of patients which tells whether that person getting a heart attack chance is less or more. Using the information explore the dataset and classify the target variable using Logistic Regression and XGBoost.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the implementation of a logistic regression-based machine learning model for predicting heart disease demonstrates promising results and potential for clinical application. Through meticulous data collection, feature engineering, and model optimization, we have developed a robust predictive tool capable of assessing the likelihood of heart disease in individuals.
